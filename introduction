<!-- JSX:- 98% of html

javascript XML
we  write HTMl tags inside javascript -->

<!-- const elemenet = <h>HELLO</h>

jsx will be translated into normal javascript by Babel -->

<!-- some rules


. we can,t return one html element at once but we can wrap the elements inside a parent html tag do value return krna  hai to use ek tga ke andr wrap krna hoga 
. we can use JSx inside for loops,if else cases
. html attribute names like "class" becomes "className" -->
<!-- .in jsx html tags must always be closed -->


<!-- REact component 
a component is an independent ,reusable code block which divieds the UI into smaller pieces -->
<!-- has two type component :-functional(stateless) and class(stateful) -->
<!-- funcitonal component:- PROPS MEANS PROPERTIES
function Welcome(props){
    return <h1>Hello,{props.name}</h1>;
} -->



<!-- react has a dif approach to data flow 
props is a special keyword in reat being used for passing the data from one component to another 
unidirectional flow from parent component to child

define its attribute and its value -->
<!-- then pass it to child component by using props -->
